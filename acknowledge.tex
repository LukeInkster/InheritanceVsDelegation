\chapter*{Acknowledgments}\label{C:ack}
I would like to acknowledge a number of people who have helped and supported me throughout this project.
\newline\newline
First, I would like to express my gratitude to Dr. Alex Potanin, Prof. James Noble, and Timothy Jones who supervised this project throughout the year. Their support and guidance has been invaluable, and they have always been willing to help when I needed it.
\newline\newline
Secondly, I would like to thank my friends and family who have supported me through the year. Particularly to my Mum, who has offered endless support throughout my studies. I am thankful to Brianna, who has helped me get through this final year. She was always available to proof read my work, and get my head straight when I needed it. I am also grateful to my flatmates; Lucy, Mohana, and Ged, who made sure I ate and slept well, despite all the work.
\newline\newline
Finally, I would like to thank my classmates. Jack and Glen, in particular, have helped me more than they could know through the last few years, always offering feedback on my work and helping out when I needed it.
