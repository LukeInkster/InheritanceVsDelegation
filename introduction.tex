\chapter{Introduction}\label{C:intro}
The aim of this project is to provide a clearer understanding of the ways delegation and inheritance are used in real world software development projects across programming languages with varying support for each. This is achieved by parsing existing examples of programming projects to produce empirical evidence of the frequency at which these two structures are used in typical programs.

\section{Motivation}
The motivation of this study is to answer the question "Is delegation useful?" by investigating the extent to which developers make use of it in their software projects. This information can inform the design of new programming languages which must, to some extent, make a choice between an inheritance or delegation based object model.

\section{Proposed Solution}
To determine the usefulness of delegation relative to classical inheritance, this study will compare the prevalence of patterns representative delegation in inheritance based languages and the prevalence of class usage in languages which natively do not support them.
