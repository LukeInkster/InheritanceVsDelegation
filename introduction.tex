\chapter{Introduction}\label{C:intro}
The aim of this study is to provide a clearer understanding of the ways delegation and classical inheritance are used in real world software development projects across programming languages with varying native support for each. This is achieved by parsing existing examples of software projects to produce empirical evidence of the frequency at which these two structures are used in typical programs.

\section{Motivation}
Code reuse mechanisms are a vital aspect of software development. They allow engineers to write code once and make use of it in various places without having create duplicates of that code. In allowing this, code reuse aims to reduce the time and resources required to produce a software system by maximising the usefulness of each asset produced. Higher reuse of code also ensures that, when changes must be made to the system, a single software modification can enact the desired change in more areas of the program.
\newline
Typically, code reuse takes two major forms:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Inheritance - Inheriting the properties of some parent object to a child object.
	\item Composition - Objects contain other objects and delegate responsibility to them.
\end{itemize}
Each of these has its uses and comes with distinct advantages and disadvantages. Languages built with native support for delegation typically encourage the use of composition over inheritance where possible. In contrast, languages built with native support for classical inheritance will usually encourage developers to reuse code through inheritance relationships between classes.
\newline
The motivation of this study is to answer the question "Is delegation useful?". This will be investigated by studying the extent to which developers make use of it in their software projects and the ways they could if their language had stronger native support. This information can inform the design of new programming languages which must, to some extent, make a choice between an inheritance or delegation based object model.

\section{Proposed Solution}
To determine the usefulness of delegation relative to classical inheritance, this study will compare the prevalence of patterns representative of delegation in inheritance based languages and the prevalence of class usage in languages which natively do not support them. This involves employing a variety code analysis of tools to parse out these patterns from samples of each language allowing an empirical analysis surrounding the extent to which programmers in each language are making use of each pattern.

\section{Goals}
The goal of this study is to gather information which can drive design decisions in new programming languages by offering an empirical perspective on the use of delegation and inheritance across software development projects in existing languages.
