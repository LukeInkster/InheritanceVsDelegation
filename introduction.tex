\chapter{Introduction}\label{C:intro}
The aim of this study is to provide a clearer understanding of the ways delegation and classical inheritance are used in real world software development projects across programming languages with varying native support for each. This is achieved by parsing existing examples of software projects to produce empirical evidence of the frequency at which these two structures are used in typical programs.

\section{Motivation}
The motivation of this study is to answer the question "Is delegation useful?" by investigating the extent to which developers make use of it in their software projects. This information can inform the design of new programming languages which must, to some extent, make a choice between an inheritance or delegation based object model.

\section{Proposed Solution}
To determine the usefulness of delegation relative to classical inheritance, this study will compare the prevalence of patterns representative of delegation in inheritance based languages and the prevalence of class usage in languages which natively do not support them. This involves employing a variety code analysis of tools to parse out these patterns from samples of each language allowing an empirical analysis surrounding the extent to which programmers in each language are making use of each pattern.

\section{Goals}
The goal of this study is to gather information which can drive design decisions in new programming languages by offering an empirical perspective on the use of delegation and inheritance across software development projects in existing languages.
