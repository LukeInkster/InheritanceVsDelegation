\chapter{Conclusions}\label{C:con}
Some conclusions can be drawn from the data gathered thus far. This data covers the analyses of Java and JavaScript corpus data. It was found that there was a reasonable amount of crossover between the native support offered by each language and the patterns used by developers:
\begin{itemize}
	\item In Java, where classical inheritance is natively supported, 6.09\% of classes used forwarding patterns and 4.45\% of classes used delegation patterns.
	\item In JavaScript, where delegation is natively supported, 15\% of the functions in the median project were used to emulate class or method behaviour.
	\item In Lua, where delegation is natively supported, 17.04\% of all files contained patterns indicative of class behaviour.
\end{itemize}
From these numbers, it appears developers are more wiling to use inheritance structures,  thus ignoring native delegation. Further research on other languages will help to clarify this claim.
