This report presents an empirical study of how delegation and inheritance are used in existing programming languages. The aim of this study is to determine whether classical inheritance could be replaced with delegation in modern programming languages. This study is intended to drive the design of new programming languages which must, to some extent, choose between these object inheritance models. These goals are achieved through an exploration of patterns representing delegation and inheritance in languages which support their implementation followed by a comparison of their use.
