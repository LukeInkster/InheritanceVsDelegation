This report covers an empirical study of how delegation and inheritance are used in existing programming languages. The aim of this study is to answer the question "Is delegation useful?" in a way that can be used to drive the design of new programming languages. This is achieved through an exploration of patterns of delegation and inheritance in languages which support their implementation and through a comparison of the uses of both.
